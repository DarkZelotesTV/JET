## Description
<details>
<summary>English description</summary>
  
This Modpack adds new helicopters, jets and weapons to your game. You can build big military bases with mod like Chisel and Malisis Doors and fight you enimies to the death using MCHeli or Modern Warfare. If you are a passive person, you can get rich by building a factory to produce and sell weapons to the fighting parties. 

Because of the MCHeli mod, you should use [**Optifine**](https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=OptiFine_1.7.10_HD_U_E7.jar) because the vehicles will shiver around if you don't install it.
